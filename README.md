🎯 Accordion - FAQ Section | Mini Project using HTML, CSS & JavaScript
This GitHub repository contains a mini project that demonstrates how to build a simple and clean Accordion-style FAQ section using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. The project replicates the frequently asked questions (FAQ) feature commonly seen on websites, where each question can be expanded or collapsed to reveal or hide the answer.

The accordion layout is ideal for displaying multiple questions in a compact format, enhancing user experience by reducing page clutter and improving readability. Clicking on a question toggles the visibility of the corresponding answer with a smooth transition effect, providing a professional and responsive interface.

This project is a great starting point for beginners looking to understand basic DOM manipulation and transitions using JavaScript and CSS. It’s built without any external libraries or frameworks, keeping the code lightweight and easy to understand.
